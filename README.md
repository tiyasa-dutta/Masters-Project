Analysis of Elementary Chirp and Chirp models which are widely used in the field of signal processing.
Chirp signals play a very crucial role in various signal processing applications, ranging from radar
and sonar systems to biomedical imaging and communication systems. Here we study a brief analysis of
the Elementary Chirp model and Chirp model. We first provide an overview of both models, discussing
their mathematical formulations and underlying assumptions. We discuss how to estimate the unknown
parameters of the model using our usual Least Squares method and Approximate Least squares method.
Also we perform some numerical experiments to study the finite sample performance of the two estimation
methods. Additionally, we analyse two Sonar data using both the models.
